# nology-music-orders
A simple music store model

This represents a top level design for an on-line music shop.

Some useful information:
+ the shop sells physical items - CDs and vinyl
+ physical items obviously need to be packed and delivered to customers
+ the shop also sells downloads
+ the price for an item can be in a number of currencies
+ no payment information is stored in the system, that is all handled by a third party application
+ the store keeps a record of their customers, including what they've purchased previously, and their addresses etc.

#### Challenge:

From the classes draw a simple Class Diagram that describes the current design.
